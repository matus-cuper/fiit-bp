  abstract = {The efforts of the European Union (EU) in the energy supply domain aim to introduce intelligent grid management across the whole of the EU. The target intelligent grid is planned to contain 80{\%} of all meters to be smart meters generating data every 15 minutes. Thus, the energy data of EU will grow rapidly in the very near future. Smart meters are successively installed in a phased roll-out, and the first smart meter data samples are ready for different types of analysis in order to understand the data, to make precise predictions and to support intelligent grid control. In this paper, we propose an incremental heterogeneous ensemble model for time series prediction. The model was designed to make predictions for electricity load time series taking into account their inherent characteristics, such as seasonal dependency and concept drift. The proposed ensemble model characteristics – robustness, natural ability to parallelize and the ability to incrementally train the model – make the presented ensemble suitable for processing streams of data in a " big data " environment.},

  abstract = {Load forecasts are extremely important for energy suppliers and other participants in electric energy generation, transmission, distribution and markets. Accurate models for electric power load forecasting are essential to the operation and planning of a utility company. Load forecasts are extremely important for energy suppliers and other participants in electric energy generation, transmission, distribution and markets. This paper presents a review of electricity demand forecasting techniques. The various types of methodologies and models are included in the literature. Load forecasting can be broadly divided into three categories: short-term forecasts which are usually from one hour to one week, medium forecasts which are usually from a week to a year, and long-term forecasts which are longer than a year. Based on the various types of studies presented in these papers, the load forecasting techniques may be presented in three major groups: Traditional Forecasting technique, Modified Traditional Technique and Soft Computing Technique. 1. Introduction Load forecasting helps an electric utility to make important decisions including decisions on purchasing and generating electric power, load switching, and infrastructure development. The subject of load forecasting has been in existence for decades to forecast the future demand. This involves the accurate prediction of both the magnitudes and geographical locations of electric load over the different periods of the planning horizon. Electricity demand forecasting is considered as one of the critical factors for economic operation of power systems, Bunn and Farmer [1] infers that accurate load forecasting holds a great saving potential for electric utility corporations. The maximum savings can be achieved when load forecasting is used to control operations and decisions like economic dispatch/ unit commitment and fuel allocation /on -line network analysis. According to Haida and Muto [2], the operating cost is increased due to the forecasting errors (either positive or negative). This part of the research work is necessary to establish the statistical relevance of the proposed research work, establish a generalized research question, analyzing existing methods, and explore areas of possible improvements. This chapter covers the analysis of various existing load forecasting techniques which provides up-to-date brief mathematical descriptions of each category. A comparative study of reviewed literature, findings and remarks are discussed here.},
